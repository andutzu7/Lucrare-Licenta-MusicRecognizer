[###](###) Roadmap for the project


* Gather data ✅
* Analyze data ✅
* Split data✅
* Research on the modules which i can use(for the neural net,for the wav manipulation)✅
* Use a neural net backbone like vgg16(or compose it)✅
* Train the nn✅
* Test the nn✅
* Do a inference✅
* Try to embed maya into python code/app enviroment
* Work on the 3d models ✅
* Make an app model/prototype
* Think about the platform it will be deployed on✅
* Make a few demos✅
* Integrate the neural net and maya modules
* Make statistics
* Make a data showing(plotting the before and after signal envelope threshhold)
