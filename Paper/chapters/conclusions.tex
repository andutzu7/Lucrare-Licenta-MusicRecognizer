The three constituent parts of the application (as presented in Chapter 3 of the current paper) form a project that serves its purpose: to both create a middle way between arts and computer science, making the applications of machine learning interesting, yet engaging and to get  a deeper understanding, by implementing the neuronal network framework from scratch, of the mathematical and theoretical subtilities of artificial intelligence.

		The application succeeds in creating the liaison between an intuitive and friendly user experience and the complex background of the custom machine learning framework. Therefore, we believe that the current thesis corresponds with the initial ambition of the project.
