In the age of \textit{big data} and immense computational power, artificial intelligence has come to be the new standard in the computer science field. Various types of data can be understood, learnt, predicted and even produced by a well-tuned neuronal network, making the principles of machine learning a must for a scientist nowadays.\\


Applications of neuronal networks can be found in any discipline: from medicine to physics, social sciences and languages. The purpose of this thesis is to depict how artificial intelligence can find it's place and purpose in a previously profoundly human field: art.
